# Firewalls

Firewalls act as security barriers, controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on defined rules. They prevent unauthorized access and malicious activity. Adding a firewall is crucial to protect sensitive data and systems within the infrastructure.

# HTTPS

HTTPS encrypts communication between the server and client, safeguarding data from interception and tampering. Using HTTPS is essential for secure transmission of sensitive information like login credentials or financial data.

# Monitoring

Monitoring tools track various aspects of the infrastructure, like performance, resource usage, and security events. Monitoring helps identify and address issues before they become critical, ensuring smooth operation and security.

# Data collection in monitoring tools

Monitoring tools gather data through various methods, including logs, metrics, and network traffic analysis. The specific method depends on the tool and the data being collected.

# Monitoring web server QPS

To monitor web server QPS (queries per second), use tools that track incoming requests and calculate the rate. Popular options include Prometheus, Grafana, and Datadog. Monitoring QPS helps identify performance bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation, and ensure server capacity meets demand.
